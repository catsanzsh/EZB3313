EZB3313

EZB3313 is an ambitious open-source project designed to recreate the immersive and eerie world of Super Mario 64 B3313 using the powerful, Python-based Ursina engine. This project aims to faithfully replicate the non-Euclidean, surreal experience of the original ROM hack, complete with procedural level generation, atmospheric effects, and intuitive mechanics.

Features

Non-Euclidean Level Design: Explore infinite, seamlessly connected worlds with mind-bending geometry.

Procedural Generation: Dynamically generated worlds ensure a unique experience with every playthrough.

Zero-Shot Rendering: No pre-rendered assets; all visuals are procedurally generated at runtime.

Immersive Atmosphere: Custom sound and visual effects replicate the haunting ambiance of B3313.

Cross-Platform: Built using Ursina, EZB3313 runs smoothly on Windows, Linux, and macOS.
